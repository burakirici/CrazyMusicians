Sure! Below is an example of how you could build an ASP.NET Core Web API for "Crazy Musicians" with basic CRUD functionality, validation, routing, and other requested elements.

Project Structure:
Controllers: For handling the API endpoints.
Models: Defines the structure for data.
DTOs: Data transfer objects for clean input/output.
Services: To manage the logic and handle operations with data.
Validation: Input validation for API requests.
Routing: Routes structured similarly to "Galactic Tour".
